DCPlusPlusRegistrationWebsite
=============================

A website to register for access to a DC++ (dbhub) server.

I created a website in school to allow others to register for access to my DC++ server which was running an instance of DBHub.
Users will enter in their basic information which is then checked before being entered into a MySql database. 
An email will then be dispatched to the user with an autogenerated link to which the user has to click to confirm their account.
Once the user clicks on the link in their email, the Verified bit in the database will be set and the user (nick and pass)
will be added to the reg list in the dbhub folder to which they can log in.

-There is no email server connected to this implementation.  I know, I just didn't feel like making one.  
-The input sanitization isn't the greatest.  This was just a proof of concept which worked.
-The MySql database needs to be setup:
Database name: dcplusplus
Database table: dc_users
Columns:Name, Email, Nick, Password, Verified, Auth_Str
